# Decentralised Voting System Using Python & solidity 
- This is a simple decentralised voting application where a user can start a voting campaign, make nomination & vote for favourable candidate. 
- The base logic is smart contract written in solidity.
- It's using [ape](https://www.apeworx.io/) as the development framework to interact with the smart contract.

## TODO
- Implement the frontend so that normal users can interact with it.
- Contributions are most welcome :)
